## Throughput framing from the introduction

Before the benchmark tables, the introduction gives the paper’s top deployment-facing claim.

### Throughput setting used in the intro

| Field | Value |
|---|---|

### What the base table says qualitatively

Nano3 Base is especially strong relative to Qwen3 Base on:

- code
- math
- long context
- several commonsense tasks

Qwen3 Base remains ahead on:

- MMLU
- ARC-Challenge
- RACE
- MMLU Global Lite

So the paper’s base-model claim is not “wins everywhere.”
It is “wins on many of the technically important axes, especially math/code/long-context.”

### Paper’s qualitative interpretation of Table 3

The paper explicitly claims Nano3:

- is competitive with GPT-OSS on reasoning
- surpasses Qwen3 on reasoning in many places
- significantly outperforms both models on agentic, chat, and long-context categories

### Important nuance

Table 3 is broad enough that the cleanest honest summary is:

- Nano3 is not the top model on every single benchmark
- but it is very strong across many categories at once, especially the multi-capability mix NVIDIA cares about

## Evaluation tooling and reproducibility notes

The paper says results were collected with:

- Nemo Evaluator SDK
- Nemo Skills Harness for most benchmarks
- dedicated packaged containers for some suites such as TauBench, ArenaHard v2, and AA-LCR
- official open-source implementations for Terminal Bench, SWE-Bench, and Scale AI Multi Challenge when not yet onboarded in NVIDIA’s tooling

This is important because it tells you where to look when a user asks “how were these numbers measured?”

## 4.1 Quantization calibration dataset

The paper says FP8 PTQ calibration used:

- a small **1K-sample** subset from the post-training reasoning SFT dataset

It also says this recovered accuracy slightly better than using CNN/DailyMail and that using on-policy BF16 generations did not help further.

## 4.2 Selective PTQ strategy

The selective FP8 strategy is specific and important.

### Layers kept in BF16

The paper says:

- the **6 self-attention layers** are most sensitive and are kept in BF16
- the **6 Mamba layers feeding into those attention layers** are also kept in BF16
- Conv1D inside all Mamba layers stays in BF16

### What is quantized to FP8

The paper says the following are quantized to FP8:

- model weights
- activations
- KV cache

### Claimed sweet spot

The authors say this mixed-precision choice gives the best trade-off between recovery and efficiency.

| AA-LCR | 35.85 | 36.06 |
| MMLU-ProX | 59.50 | 59.63 |

### Paper’s quantization takeaways

The paper says:

- FP8 achieves about **99% median accuracy recovery** relative to BF16
- FP8 KV cache significantly helps throughput by allowing larger batch sizes
- more aggressive quantization hurts accuracy more
- selective quantization preserves most of the BF16 accuracy while improving efficiency

## Appendix E Prompt Sensitivity

The paper evaluates prompt sensitivity as the standard deviation of prompt-averaged accuracy across multiple prompt variants and seeds.

### Table 8 reconstructed as markdown

| Benchmark | N-3-Nano | Qwen3 | GPT-OSS |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| GPQA (no tools) | 0.42 | 0.59 | 1.91 |
| MMLU-Pro | 0.41 | 0.31 | 1.46 |
| Comp-Math-24-25 (no tools) | 0.77 | 0.51 | 1.14 |
| LiveCodeBench | 0.83 | 1.05 | 1.02 |

### Prompt sensitivity conclusion

The paper says Nano3 stays below **1** on all reported prompt-sensitivity datasets, which it interprets as strong stability under ordinary prompt variation.

## Best compact answer patterns

### “How good is base Nano3?”

Use Table 2 and emphasize:

- strong code
- strong math
- strong long context

### “How good is post-trained Nano3?”

Use Table 3 and emphasize:

- AIME25 with tools: 99.17
- SWE-Bench: 38.76
- TauBench average: 49.04
- IFBench: 71.51
- RULER-100 @ 1M: 86.34

### “How much does FP8 hurt?”

Use Table 4 and say:

- generally modest impact
- about 99% median accuracy recovery overall
- strong throughput upside from selective PTQ and FP8 KV cache

### “Is Nano3 prompt-stable?”

Use Table 8 and say:

- yes, according to the paper’s metric, scores stay below 1 on the datasets reported
