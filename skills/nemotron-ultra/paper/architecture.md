title: "Nemotron 3 Ultra Architecture: Hybrid Mamba-Attention LatentMoE, Table 1 Dimensions, MTP"
summary: |
  Nemotron 3 Ultra reuses the same hybrid Mamba-Attention Mixture-of-Experts architecture as Nemotron 3
  Super, scaled to 550B total / 55B active parameters. It uses LatentMoE for MoE layers and native
  Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) with two shared-weight heads for inference acceleration. Table 1 gives the
  108-layer, 8192-dim configuration; Figure 2 shows the layer pattern of interleaved Mamba-2, Attention,
  and LatentMoE blocks.
key_facts:
  - "Same hybrid Mamba-Attention MoE architecture as Nemotron 3 Super, extended to 550B total / 55B active parameters per token."
  - "Uses LatentMoE (Elango et al., 2026) for MoE layers, same as Super3."
  - "Native Multi-Token Prediction with two heads during pre-training; both MTP heads share the same parameters."
  - "Each MTP head consists of a single attention layer followed by a single MoE layer."
  - "Total Layers: 108."
  - "Model Dimension: 8192."
  - "Q-Heads (n_q): 64; KV-Heads (n_kv): 2; Head Dimension: 128."
  - "Mamba State Dimension: 128; Mamba Groups: 8; Mamba Heads: 256; Mamba Head Dimension: 64."
  - "Expert Hidden Dimension: 5120; Shared Expert Intermediate Size: 10240."
  - "Total Experts per Layer: 512; Top-k (activated experts): 22; MoE Latent Size: 2048."
  - "MTP layers (shared weight): 2."

# Scope
Answers:
- What architecture does Nemotron 3 Ultra use, and how does it relate to Nemotron 3 Super?
- What are the exact model dimensions (layers, heads, experts, MoE config)?
- How is MTP configured?
- What is the layer pattern (Figure 2)?

# Architecture Lineage (§2.1)
- Reuses the **same hybrid Mamba-Attention Mixture-of-Experts architecture as Nemotron 3 Super** (NVIDIA, 2026), extended to 550B total / 55B active parameters per token.
- **LatentMoE** (Elango et al., 2026) for MoE layers — same as Super3, scaled to 550B/55B.
- **Native MTP** for inference acceleration with **two heads during pre-training**; both MTP heads **share the same parameters** for robust autoregressive drafting (as in NVIDIA 2026). Each MTP head = one attention layer + one MoE layer.

# Figure 2 — Layer Pattern
Hybrid Mamba-Attention architecture scaled sparsely with LatentMoE layers, similar to Nemotron 3 Super. The interleaved block sequence shown (with repeat multipliers x3, x2, x3, x3, x4) is built from Mamba-2, Attention, and Latent MoE blocks:

Mamba-2 / Latent MoE (x3) -> Mamba-2 / Attention / Latent MoE (x2) -> Mamba-2 / LatentMoE (x3) -> Mamba-2 / Attention / Latent MoE / Mamba-2 / Latent MoE (x3) -> ... (x4), as depicted in Figure 2.

(The exact per-segment block order is a figure rendering; the load-bearing facts are: hybrid Mamba-2 + Attention + LatentMoE, total 108 layers per Table 1.)

# Caveats
- The precise Figure 2 block ordering and repeat-multiplier grouping is reconstructed from a figure; treat the 108 total-layer count (Table 1) as authoritative, not a hand-counted figure traversal.
- MaxVio_max = 23.27 for Ultra and Super (E/k = 512/22) is a derived stability metric; it lives in pretraining.md (§2.7), not here.
- LatentMoE and MTP internals are documented in the Nemotron 3 Super report (NVIDIA, 2026) and cited references; this chunk only states Ultra's reuse and dimensions.
