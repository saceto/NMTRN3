"""Backend protocol + registry for ``nemotron steps run``.

A ``Backend`` knows how to take a parsed step (script + runspec + rendered
config + env profile) and submit it for execution. ``steps run`` selects a
backend by name from the env profile's ``executor`` field and calls
:meth:`Backend.submit`. Adding a new backend is one new file under this
package — ``steps run`` itself does not change.
