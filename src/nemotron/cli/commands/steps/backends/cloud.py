"""Cloud backend — Lepton + DGX Cloud.

Most steps pick their cloud submission shape from the runspec's ``launch``
field:

* ``launch = "ray"``   → :func:`execute_cloud_ray` builds a multi-pod
  RayCluster (head + workers) and submits a RayJob. Required by NeMo-RL,
  which expects a single shared Ray cluster spanning every GPU pod.
* otherwise            → :func:`execute_cloud` submits as a Lepton
  distributed workload; ``execute_cloud`` handles its own torchrun wrap
  for ``launch = "torchrun"`` and a bare python invocation otherwise.

Preparation steps are the exception: Xenna owns its own Ray initialization
inside the worker pod, so cloud prep runs as a plain inline workload even when
the local/Slurm runspec uses ``launch = "ray"``.

Both paths share the chunked-env-var source transport (no PatternPackager).
