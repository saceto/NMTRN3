| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [optimize/modelopt/distill](optimize/modelopt/distill/) | Distill a student model from a teacher model with NVIDIA Model Optimizer and Megatron-Bridge.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [peft/automodel](peft/automodel/) | Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) with the AutoModel stack. Same training loop as sft/automodel but with a LoRA adapter wired in by default, making larger HF backbones practical for adapter-based tuning. | training_jsonl | checkpoint_lora |
| [peft/megatron_bridge](peft/megatron_bridge/) | Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) on top of Megatron-Bridge. Useful when a full SFT exceeds memory but you still want TP/PP/CP scaling.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## sdg — Synthetic Data Generation

| Step | Description | Consumes | Produces |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [sdg/data_designer](sdg/data_designer/) | Build a NeMo Data Designer pipeline declaratively and generate synthetic data. Three recipes ship in config/: 'default' produces SFT chat data, 'customer_support_tools' produces tool-call SFT data, and 'rl_pref' produces preference pairs (chosen / rejected) for DPO.  Customisation lives in YAML — step.py just translates declarative column specs into the upstream DataDesignerConfigBuilder API. | training_jsonl (optional) | synthetic_jsonl |

## sft — Supervised Fine-Tuning

| Step | Description | Consumes | Produces |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [sft/automodel](sft/automodel/) | Supervised fine-tuning with the AutoModel stack for HF-format models and JSONL datasets that already use OpenAI chat-format messages. Supports full SFT and LoRA-style adapter tuning from the same step. | training_jsonl | checkpoint_hf |
