"""Prompt templates for distractor expansion stage.

This module contains prompts for expanding multiple-choice questions from 4 choices
(A, B, C, D) to 10 choices (A-J) by generating 6 additional plausible but incorrect
distractor options. The LLM is instructed to create distractors that are plausible
enough to be challenging but definitively incorrect.
