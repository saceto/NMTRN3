"""Prompt templates for distractor validity checking stage.

This module contains prompts for validating that distractor (incorrect) choices are
actually incorrect based on the source text passage. The LLM verifies each choice
to identify any that might actually be correct, which would make the question invalid
due to multiple correct answers. This quality control step helps ensure question integrity.
"""

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an expert in text comprehension. You will be given a text passage on a topic and a question.
The question claims that there is only one correct answer among the {num_choices} choices.

You should
1. Look at the question and the given answer.
2. Look at the options and see if they are same as the correct answer.
3. Check if any of the options that are not the correct answer are actually correct based on the text passage.

Example:
"True, False" is the same as "True, Not True"

Topic: {{target_subject}}
