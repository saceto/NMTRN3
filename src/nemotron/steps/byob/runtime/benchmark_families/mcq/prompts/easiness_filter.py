"""Prompt templates for easiness filtering stage.

This module contains prompts for determining if a question is too easy. Multiple LLM
models are asked to answer the question without access to the source text passage.
Questions where most models answer correctly are flagged as too easy, as they can be
answered using general knowledge rather than requiring comprehension of the specific text.
This helps maintain appropriate difficulty levels in the generated question set.
"""

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are answering a multiple-choice question with {num_choices} choices.
You will be given a question and a list of choices.
Answer the question and choose the correct choice from the list of choices."""

PROMPT = """Answer the following question:

{{{{question_generated_formatted}}}}

The answer should be one of {choices}. Think step by step and then finish your answer with "The answer is (X)" where X is the correct letter choice."""
