description: Work with Nemotron execution environment profiles, especially env.toml generation, Lepton, Slurm, and DGX Cloud executor settings, RayCluster resources, mounts, container images, and profile inheritance. Use when selecting, creating, or debugging run profiles.

# Env Steps

Use this category for execution-profile setup under `src/nemotron/steps/env/`.

## Route

- `env/env_toml`: generate and validate starter env profile examples for Lepton, Slurm, or DGX Cloud.

## Guardrails

- Read the specific step `README.md` and `step.toml` before editing env profiles.
- Keep env profile files at the repository root. Default profile discovery uses `env.toml`; generated backend examples use `env.lepton.toml`, `env.slurm.toml`, or `env.dgxcloud.toml` and require `export NEMOTRON_ENV_FILE=<file>`.
- If the target env file exists, inspect and extend it rather than overwriting; only use `force=true` when the user intentionally asks to replace it.
- Keep site logistics in env profiles and step runtime flags in the step YAML unless the flag is truly site-wide.
- Keep data-prep step profiles CPU-only unless the step explicitly needs GPUs. Slurm prep profiles should override GPU bases with CPU partitions and `gpus_per_node = 0`; Lepton prep profiles should use a CPU resource shape; DGX Cloud prep profiles should keep `gpus_per_node = 0` and stage source on `PYTHONPATH` for Ray workers.
- Use the NeMo-RL v0.6.0 image for DPO/RLVR/RLHF profiles on Lepton, Slurm, and DGX Cloud. On Lepton, keep `ray_version` on the latest version supported by the workspace rather than blindly matching the upstream NeMo-RL Ray pin.
- Compile one small run after profile changes and inspect `run.env` before submitting.
